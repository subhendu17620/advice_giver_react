This project was crated with `create-react-app`. 

I made this to understand the API - callback in React. It is beginner level project.

API source : `https://api.adviceslip.com/advice`

This API generates random advice on every call. The website is deployed using `gh-pages`.

### Technologies used: 

* Axios
